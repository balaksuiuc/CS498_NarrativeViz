### Narrative structure
I used a Martini glass narrative structure. The first visualization (default) shows 5 of the DM and 5 of the EM rates changes over a couple of decades. This is the author driven step. 

The reader can then click on the tabs to illustrate the other points about DM vs EM central bank behaviors. 

Take together, this narrative forms a martini glass structure.
