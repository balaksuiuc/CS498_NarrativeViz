### Message
There are three key messages in this visualization: 

1. Central banks around the world are a lot more active in raising and lowering rates than most people perceive

2. Most central banks follow the US lead, especially in times of crises

3. But EM banks tend to raise rates faster during the recovery phase

### Narrative structure
I used a Martini glass narrative structure. The first visualization (default) shows 5 of the DM and 5 of the EM rates changes over a couple of decades. This is the author driven step. 

The reader can then click on the tabs to illustrate the other points about DM vs EM central bank behaviors. 

Take together, this narrative forms a martini glass structure.
